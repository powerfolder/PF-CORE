/**
 * The standard base class to implement the <em>Presentation Model</em> pattern,
 * that represents the state and behavior of a presentation independently 
 * of the GUI components used in the interface. This 
 * <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html">pattern</a>
 * is described in Martin Fowler's upcoming 
 * <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/">addition</a>
 * to his "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture". More details 
 * around this implementation of the Presentation Model pattern and a 3-tier 
 * Swing client architecture with a presentation model layer can be found in 
 * the <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/articles/binding.pdf">JGoodies 
 * Binding presentation</a>. This architecture is supported
 * by the JGoodies Binding library. The PresentationModel pattern is known 
 * to users of VisualWorks Smalltalk as <em>ApplicationModel</em>.<p>
 * 
 * This class minimizes the effort required to bind, edit, 
 * buffer, and observe the bound properties of an exchangeable bean.
 * Therefore it provides five groups of features that are described below:<ol>
 * <li>adapt bean properties,
 * <li>change the adapted bean,
 * <li>buffer values,
 * <li>observe the buffering state, and
 * <li>track changes in adapted bean properties.
 * </ol><p>
 * 
 * Typically this class will be extended to add custom models, Actions, 
 * presentation logic, model operations and other higher-level behavior. 
 * However, in simple cases you can use this class as-is.
 * Several methods are intended to be used as-is and a typical subclass
 * should not modify them. For example #isChanged, #isBuffering, 
 * #getBean, #setBean, #getBeanChannel, #getModel, #getBufferedModel, 
 * #getTriggerChannel, #setTriggerChannel, #triggerCommit and #triggerFlush.<p>
 * 
 * <strong>Adapting Bean Properties</strong><br> 
 * The method {@link #getModel(String)} vends ValueModels that adapt 
 * a bound bean property of an exchangable bean. These ValueModels will be 
 * requested from an underlying BeanAdapter.
 * To get such a model you specify the name of the bean property.
 * All properties adapted must be read-write and must comply with 
 * the Java Bean coding conventions. 
 * In case you need to adapt a read-only or write-only property, 
 * or if the bean uses custom names for the reader and writer, 
 * use {@link #getModel(String, String, String)}.
 * Also note that you must not mix calls to these methods for the same
 * property name. For details see the JavaDoc class comment in
 * {@link com.jgoodies.binding.beans.BeanAdapter}.<p> 
 * 
 * <strong>Changing the Adapted Bean</strong><br>
 * The adapted bean is not stored in this PresentationModel.
 * Instead it is held by a ValueModel, the <em>bean channel</em>
 * - just as in the PropertyAdapter and BeanAdapter.
 * This indirection enables you to manage the adapted bean outside
 * of this PresentationModel, and it enables you to share bean channels 
 * between multiple PresentationModels, PropertyAdapters, and BeanAdapters.
 * The bean channel is used by all adapting models created 
 * by the factory methods <code>#getModel</code>.
 * You can get and set the current bean by means of <code>#getBean</code>
 * and <code>#setBean</code>. Or you can set a new value to the bean channel.<p> 
 * 
 * PresentationModel fires three PropertyChangeEvents if the bean changes:
 * <i>beforeBean</i>, <i>bean</i> and <i>afterBean</i>. This is useful
 * when sharing a bean channel and you must perform an operation before
 * or after other listeners handle a bean change. Since you cannot rely
 * on the order listeners will be notified, only the <i>beforeBean</i> 
 * and <i>afterBean</i> events are guaranteed to be fired before and
 * after the bean change is fired. 
 * Note that <code>#getBean()</code> returns the new bean before
 * any of these three PropertyChangeEvents is fired. Therefore listeners 
 * that handle these events must use the event's old and new value 
 * to determine the old and new bean. 
 * The order of events fired during a bean change is:<ol>
 * <li>the bean channel fires a <i>value</i> change,
 * <li>this model fires a <i>beforeBean</i> change,
 * <li>this model fires the <i>bean</i> change,
 * <li>this model fires an <i>afterBean</i> change.
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <strong>Buffering Values</strong><br>
 * At the core of this feature are the methods {@link #getBufferedModel(String)}
 * that vend BufferedValueModels that wrap an adapted bean property.
 * The buffer can be commited or flushed using <code>#triggerCommit</code>
 * and <code>#triggerFlush</code> respectively.<p>
 * 
 * The trigger channel is provided as a bound Java bean property 
 * <em>triggerChannel</em> that must be a non-<code>null</code> 
 * <code>ValueModel</code> with values of type <code>Boolean</code>. 
 * Attempts to read or write other value types may be rejected 
 * with runtime exceptions.
 * By default the trigger channel is initialized as an instance of
 * <code>Trigger</code>. As an alternative it can be set in the constructor.<p>
 * 
 * <strong>Observing the Buffering State</strong><br>
 * This class also provides support for observing the buffering state
 * of the BufferedValueModels created with this model. The buffering state
 * is useful for UI actions and operations that are enabled or disabled
 * if there are pending changes, for example on OK or APPLY button.
 * API users can request the buffering state via <code>#isBuffering</code> 
 * and can observe the bound property <em>buffering</em>.<p>  
 * 
 * <strong>Tracking Changes in the Adapted Bean</strong><br>
 * PresentationModel provides support for observing bean property changes 
 * and it tracks all changes to report the overall changed state. 
 * The latter is useful to detect whether the bean has changed at all,
 * for example to mark the bean as dirty, so it will be updated in a database.
 * API users can request the changed state via <code>#isChanged</code> 
 * and can observe the bound property <em>changed</em>.
 * If you want to track changes of other ValueModels, bean properties,
 * or of submodels, register them using <code>#observeChanged</code>.
 * To reset the changed state invoke <code>#resetChanged</code>.
 * In case you track the changed state of submodels you should override
 * <code>#resetChanged</code> to reset the changed state in these submodels.<p>
 * 
 * The changed state changes once only (from false to true). If you need
 * instant notifications about changes in the properties of the target bean,
 * you can register PropertyChangeListeners with this model. This is useful 
 * if you change the bean and don't want to move your listeners from one bean
 * to the other. And it's useful if you want to observe multiple bean 
 * properties at the same time. These listeners are managed by the method set
 * <code>#addBeanPropertyChangeListener</code> and
 * <code>#removeBeanPropertyChangeListener</code>.
 * Listeners registered via these methods will be removed 
 * from the old bean before the bean changes and will be re-added after 
 * the new bean has been set. Therefore these listeners will be notified 
 * about changes only if the current bean changes a property. They won't be
 * notified if the bean changes - and in turn the property value. If you want
 * to observes property changes caused by bean changes too, register with
 * the adapting ValueModel as returned by <code>#getModel(String)</code>.<p>
 * 
 * <strong>Instance Creation</strong><br>
 * PresentationModel can be instantiated using four different constructors:
 * you can specify the target bean directly, or you can provide a 
 * <em>bean channel</em> to access the bean indirectly. 
 * In the latter case you specify a <code>ValueModel</code>
 * that holds the bean that in turn holds the adapted property.
 * In both cases the target bean is accessed indirectly through 
 * the bean channel. In both cases you can specify a custom trigger channel,
 * or you can use a default trigger channel.<p>
 * 
 * <strong>Note:</strong> This PresentationModel provides bound bean properties
 * and you can register and deregister PropertyChangeListers as usual using 
 * <code>#addPropertyChangeListener</code> and 
 * <code>#removePropertyChangeListener</code>. Do not mix up 
 * the model listeners with the listeners registered with the bean.<p>
 * 
 * <strong>Warning:</strong> PresentationModels register a 
 * PropertyChangeListener with the target bean. Hence, a bean has a reference 
 * to any PresentationModel that holds it as target bean. To avoid memory leaks 
 * it is recommended to remove this listener if the bean lives much longer
 * than the PresentationModel, enabling the garbage collector to remove 
 * the PresentationModel.
 * Setting a PresentationModel's target bean to null removes this listener,
 * which in turn clears the reference from the bean to the PresentationModel.
 * To do so, you can call <code>setBean(null)</code> or set the
 * bean channel's value to null.
 * As an alternative you can use event listener lists in your beans
 * that implement references with <code>WeakReference</code>.<p>
 * 
 * TODO: Further improve the class comment.<p>
 * 
 * TODO: Consider adding a feature to ensure that update notifications
 * are performed in the event dispatch thread. In case the adapted bean 
 * is changed in a thread other than the event dispatch thread, such 
 * a feature would help complying with Swing's single thread rule. 
 * The feature could be implemented by an extended PropertyChangeSupport.<p>
 * 
 * TODO: I plan to improve the support for adapting beans that do not fire 
 * PropertyChangeEvents. This affects the classes PropertyAdapter, BeanAdapter, 
 * and PresentationModel. Basically the PropertyAdapter and the BeanAdapter's
 * internal SimplePropertyAdapter's shall be able to optionally self-fire 
 * a PropertyChangeEvent in case the bean does not. There are several 
 * downsides with self-firing events compared to bound bean properties.
 * See <a href="https://binding.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=49">Issue
 * 49</a> for more information about the downsides.<p>
 * 
 * The observeChanges constructor parameter shall be replaced by a more
 * fine-grained choice to not observe (former observeChanges=false),
 * to observe bound properties (former observeChanges=true), and a new 
 * setting for self-firing PropertyChangeEvents if a value is set.
 * The latter case may be further splitted up to specify how the
 * self-fired PropertyChangeEvent is created:
 * <ol>
 * <li>oldValue=null, newValue=null
 * <li>oldValue=null, newValue=the value set
 * <li>oldValue=value read before the set, newValue=the value set
 * <li>oldValue=value read before the set, newValue=value read after the set
 * </ol>
